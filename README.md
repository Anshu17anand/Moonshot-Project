# Vertebral Body Tumor Detection & AI-Assisted Robotic Control

**AI-Assisted Surgical Robotics for Endoscopic Spine Surgery **

A computer vision–driven system that detects vertebral body tumors in real time from an endoscopic camera feed and assists robotic navigation using **voice commands, controller input, and an offline AI assistant**.

## 📌 Overview

During endoscopic spine surgery, surgeons operate through extremely small incisions with limited visual feedback and almost no depth perception. Achieving sub-millimeter precision while removing vertebral body tumors is cognitively demanding and error-prone.

This project explores how **computer vision, voice interfaces, and local AI models** can be combined to:
- Detect spinal tumors in real time
- Provide objective spatial guidance
- Reduce manual intervention during robotic navigation

The system integrates **tumor detection**, **voice-controlled movement**, and an **AI assistant** to augment surgical decision-making.
